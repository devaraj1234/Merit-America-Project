			<h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>
			<p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object oriented scripting language. JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host environment (a web browser of Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>
						<a href="#">Variable Declaration</a> JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values-imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. <span>var x;</span>  
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<a href="#">Variable Assignment</a> Assignment operaters assign values to JavaScript variables-our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The=assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. <span>var x=10;</span> 
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<a href="#">Data Types</a> Data Types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean-<span>true</span> or <span>false;</span> null-<span>null</span> aka nothing; Number-<span>42</span> or <span>3.14159;</span> String-<span>"Codong Dojo Rocks";</span> Array-<span>[1,'Codong',2,'Dojo'];</span> and Object-<span>{first_name:'Jane',last_name:'Doe'}</span> 
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<a href="#">Conditionals</a> When you wirte code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions-hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following conditional statements. <span>if</span> a specified condition is true, do this code in our block; <span>else if</span> to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; <span>else</span> we execute this block of code;
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<a href="#">Loops</a> There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. Thats a loop
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<a href="#">Function</a> Functions are an encaspulation of a code block. when we call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as a lis of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over and over again.
